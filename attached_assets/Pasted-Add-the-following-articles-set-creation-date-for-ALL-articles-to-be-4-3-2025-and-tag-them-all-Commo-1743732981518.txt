	Chapter 1 - Prehistory:
Ages
The Paleolithic people were hunter-gatherers. This means that they hunted megafauna and gathered wild berries and fruits for their tribes. However, as the ice age started to end and megafauna died out, they needed a new option. 🦣 As the Neolithic age began, farming and  domestication became popular. Therefore, there were no more hunter-gatherers.
Cave Art
Cave paintings reveal lots, from culture to events of history. They show info as a primary source of information. The Lascaux Cave is a cave located in France.⛰️ It contains many artifacts and famous drawings of animals, being one of the most valuable historical areas in Europe. Most of them date from 17,000 years ago! 🎨
Human Migration
During around 1,000 BCE, the ancient people in Africa were experiencing a drought so badly they had to migrate. They ended up in Southern Africa, where there was an oasis. Therefore, they settled down in Southern Africa. 👍 Eventually they made their way to Southeast Asia, eventually hitting Europe and the Americas. The ice age made migration to America possible when the glaciers made land bridges to America, connecting to the migration route of the ancient people. They made new technologies to keep going through the climates of different areas. 🧊🌤️
	Chapter 2 - Cultural Hearths & Traits of Civilization
Çatalhöyük (Southwest Asia) 
🏚️ The town of Çatalhöyük, the first town known to us Homo Sapiens, was made around 🗓️7400 B.C, 9,000 years ago. It was located in Southwest Asia.🌏 It was all close together in one giant building around over 20 football fields wide! 🏘️ On the roofs of the structures were public plazas. ⛲ Their religion (probably) believed in gods, and they buried their dead. ✨Also, they made artistic carves in clay. It technologically advanced agriculture, communication, culture, and architecture. 🪨 Agriculture was central due to availability of lots of resource and water.

Banpo (China)
 Around 1,400 years after Çatalhöyük, another light bulb went off. 💡 The cultural hearth Banpo, located in China, 🌏 was made around 5000 BC. This was 1,000 years after Çatalhöyük was made. 🗓️ It had a central building with houses in a circle around it. ⭕ They ate crops, mainly their staple food of Hemp and rice. 🍙 Their religion linked the living with the dead in legend, and was from the Yangshao religion. They made large advances in art and clay. 🖌️ Their people had equal status in the village, too. 🏚️ The nice climate and predictable weather allowed them to cultivate rice so we have it today. 🍚

Oaxaca (Mesoamerica)
Oaxaca, in "Middle America", was not a settlement nor place. It was a group of nomadic people who sheltered in caves in 4250 B.C.🛡️ They cultivated Maize(corn), making it grow more kernels allowing it to be eaten. In fact, fossilized fragments were found in caves! 🌽 In fact, corn was originally Tenosite, a wild Mexican grass! ☘️ It eventually became their primary food supply. 🥗

Faiyum (North Africa)
 In 5200 BCE, while early Homo Sapiens migrated from North Africa after a drought (Last chapter), 🌵 a narrow river started to form called the Nile River Valley. 🌊 Some early Homo Sapiens stayed and made Faiyum, an oasis. 🏝️This community was Egypt's original farming community. They used cultural diffusion to gain knowledge 📚 of other cultures farming techniques and built on their own. This made Faiyum an important cultural hearth. ⛪ We know they had cultural diffusion because their agricultural practices were not all native. 🌱

	Paths and Traits of Civilizations
Göbekli Tepe 📜 
Which came first - Religion or farming? Well,  through time, cultural hearths became civilizations.🐪Back when there were hunter-gatherers, they built the first temple, Göbekli Tepe. 🕍 This meant there were traces of religion before farming. However, some religions started after agriculture. 🌰 This means that in some places, agriculture came before religion; 🐔 in others, religion came first. 🥚 No matter what, however, they both developed by 6000 B.C. 🗓️

Traits of Civilization
Civilization is built on characteristics. 📈 Five of these are cities, complex institutions, specialized workers, record keeping, and improved technology. ⚙️ Each of them have their own branches. 🌳 Cities were political, economic, and cultural centers for the surrounding areas. 🌆 Complex institutions like government and organized religion were ways to manage resources and populations. ♦️ Specialized workers performed jobs other than farming. For example, some include jobs in pottery, priesthood, weaving, or toolmaking. 🧶 Record keeping meant keeping records of important information. 🖊️ As cultures became more complex, people developed new technologies to solve problems and survive. ⚔️
	Chapter 3 - Mesopotamia Thrives
Location and Agriculture  
Ancient Mesopotamia was an ancient civilization that had many farming hardships. 🍉 Located on the southeast crescent, 🧭 between the Tigris(swift) river and the Euphrates(slow) river. 🌊 The fertile area between the two rivers was the area Mesopotamia was founded.🕍 Being fast and slow, they both were unpredictable. However, they produced VERY fertile soil. 🪴 Wheat, barley and figs were grown 🫑 when the rivers were in control and did not flood the crops. 🚿 Irrigation, watering them with man-made materials, was invented to do controlled planting. 🐂 The ox plow was used to break the soil for planting, 🌾 putting a food surplus for trade. ♻️
Sumer 
Around 3500 B.C.🗓️, Mesopotamia’s first civilization was made in the south: Sumer. 🏘️  It was composed of a dozen self-running and self-government citCy-states. They cluttered near the Tigris and Euphrates river and fought wars ⚔️ over land, resources and profit off trade routes. ♻️ Sumer had a large surplus of food but little metals and ores from underground. 💎 They traded for tin and copper, creating bronze, therefore starting the Bronze Age. 👑 Soon kings rose to hold government in Sumer. Their social class, or the power ✊ people had were ranked with kings at the top, ✝️ priests right below, then administrators, scribes, merchants, and artisans, and then farmers and slaves. 🍯
Sumerian Religion
Sumerian beliefs were closely linked to their dependence on natural forces 🌪️, leading them to worship many gods in a polytheistic system 🌈. They believed these deities controlled the unpredictable elements like floods from angry gods⛈️. Priests played a vital role in society by conducting rituals 🙏 to make the gods happy, observing stars to predict events, and maintaining ziggurats 🏛️ as temples for worship. Through offerings of food 🍞 and holy rituals 💧, they sought to ensure the favor of the gods, reflecting the deep connection between religion and daily life in Sumer. 🐴
Sargon's Reign
Sargon made Sumer - the first known empire.🎗️ Sargon the Great was born around 2334 B.C. in Mesopotamia. 🌟 Legends say he was was abandoned as a baby and was raised by a gardener🌱. He overthrew the king of his homelands ⚔️, conquered Sumer 🌍, and established the first known empire 🏛️, stretching far and wide through Sumer🌊. Sargon appointed trusted relatives as governors 👥, created a professional army 🛡️, and used agricultural practices 🌾 leading to economic prosperity 💰. He allowed conquered peoples to retain local customs 🎭 and ruled for about 56 years ⏳. His military power 🏇 and legacy 📜 influenced future empires 🌌, but after his death, his sons struggled for control ⚖️, leading to internal conflict and the empire's fall, ultimately collapsing around 2200 B.C. 🕳️
	Chapter 4 - Mesopotamia Thrives
The Gift of the Nile 
The Nile River, at 4,132 miles, is the longest river which Egypt is built upon 🌅. It has six cataracts and divides into regions including the Nile Delta Region 🌾. Its annual floods bring silt, making agriculture possible in the desert 🌵. The "black land" is fertile, while the "red land" is a protective desert rich in stone and gold 💰. This geography and the Nile's gifts fostered a thriving civilization, perfect for trade and culture 🏺.

	Chapter 8 - Greece Grows
Geography of Greece
Greece has diverse geography. 🌍 The mountainous landscape in Greece, however, made farming a challenge. 🌄 80% of Greek land was covered in mountains, with little fertile land. ⛰️ To the west of Greece was Italy, to the south was Africa, and Asia Minor was east. 🌏 However, Greece had sea travel... and lots of shipwrecks. 🚢 The Aegean Sea had 6,000 islands and many pirates, creating many shipwrecks. 🏴‍☠️ The mainland of Greece is a peninsula, and the southern tip of Greece creates another peninsula, the Peloponnesus. 🗺️ The Peloponnesus is linked to the rest of Greece by a small isthmus. 🌊 Mountains cover about 70-80% of Greece, creating an uneven landscape. ⛰️ This made land travel difficult. 🚧 Greece had no large rivers, only seas. 🌊 Greece has rainy winters and dry summers. ☔️☀️ This warm weather created outdoor athletic life in events like the Olympics and different races. 🏅
